# Accident-Data-Analysis-Using-Excel-Power-Query

🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Excel + Power Query Project 🚦
I recently worked on creating an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Excel, Power Query, and Pivot Charts.

📊 Key Highlights:
 ✔️ Cleaned and transformed raw accident data using Power Query
 ✔️ Designed a structured dashboard with KPIs (Fatal, Serious, Slight Severity, Total Casualties)
 ✔️ Built visual insights such as:
Casualties by Vehicle Type 
Urban vs Rural accident trends
Light condition analysis (Day vs Night) 
Road type accident patterns 
 ✔️ Added interactive filters & slicers for better analysis
🔧 Tools Used: Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Icons)
